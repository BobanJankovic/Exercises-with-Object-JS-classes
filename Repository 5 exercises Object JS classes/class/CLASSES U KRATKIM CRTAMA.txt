-Classes are a tool that developers use to quickly produce similar objects.
-As you can see, classes are a great way to reduce duplicate code and debugging time.

class Surgeon {
  constructor(name, department) {
    this.name = name;
    this.department = department;
  }
}
const surgeonCurry = new Surgeon('Curry','Cardiovascular'); //The NEW keyword calls the constructor(),
console.log(surgeonCurry.department);                       // runs the code inside of it, and then returns the new instance.

const surgeonDurant = new Surgeon('Durant','Orthopedics');
console.log(surgeonDurant.department);

>The SUPER keyword calls the constructor of the parent class. 
In this case, super(name) passes the name argument of the Cat class to the constructor of the Animal class.
When the Animal constructor runs, it sets this._name = name; for new Cat instances.
